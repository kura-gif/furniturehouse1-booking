      "text1": "Our encounter with 'Furniture House No.1' was in the summer of 2023. We were naturally drawn to this space, quietly nestled in the forest by Lake Yamanaka. When we first stepped inside, what caught our eyes were the neatly arranged unit furniture and the roof lightly resting upon them. The furniture directly supporting the house—it felt less like architecture and more like 'structure itself' floating in space.",
      "text2": "This house was designed in the 1990s by an architect who would later become internationally renowned. What characterizes this building is that the furniture units serve directly as the structural system. The furniture supports the roof, becomes walls, and divides the space.",
      "text3": "The resort area at Lake Yamanaka where this house stands was once a place where Japan's leading creators built their own retreats. However, due to aging, these structures have been gradually disappearing. Among the three buildings designed by this architect, two have already been demolished due to deterioration.",
      "text4": "'Furniture House No.1' also needed restoration. The humid environment of Lake Yamanaka had affected the foundation over many years. In winter 2024, we undertook restoration work, replacing all the corroded foundation and flooring while preserving the roof and furniture structure. The sight of the furniture floating in mid-air while the floor was being dismantled seemed to embody the very structure of this house.",
      "text5": "Spending time in this house, you notice how the flow of air, the shifting light, and even the way sound is absorbed are all guided by the furniture. The boundary between inside and outside is infinitely gentle, the wind passes through freely, and the architecture seems to breathe quietly.",
      "text6": "People use it, wind moves, architecture breathes—we were captivated by this experience. We want many people to not just observe, but actually stay and experience the mysterious sensation of being surrounded by furniture as structure in the quiet flow of time. That way, this house will continue to live on without decay.",

What characterized this place was that Japan's leading creators of the time commissioned their villas as opportunities for creative experimentation from renowned modern Japanese architects and young architects who would later gain international recognition, forming a community that inspired each other across disciplines.",
      "text2": "However, as time passed, these precious architectural works have gradually disappeared, and with them, their memories and cultural value are being lost. Our wish is to deeply recognize the rich stories of this place and its influence on Japan's creative scene, and to pass them on to future generations."
